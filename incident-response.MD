## According to the SANS Institute, there are six key phases of an incident response plan:

**Preparation:** Preparing users and IT staff to handle potential incidents should they should arise\
\
**Identification:** Determining whether an event is, indeed, a security incident\
\
**Containment:** Limiting the damage of the incident and isolating affected systems to prevent further damage\
\
**Eradication:** Finding the root cause of the incident, removing affected systems from the production environment\
\
**Recovery:** Permitting affected systems back into the production environment, ensuring no threat remains\
\
**Lessons learned:** Completing incident documentation, performing analysis to learn from the incident and potentially improve future response efforts
